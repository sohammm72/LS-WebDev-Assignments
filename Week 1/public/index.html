          Hi, my name is Soham Murudkar. I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering at IIT Bombay.
          I am in my 2nd year of study and thoroughly enjoying the journey so far.
          <span class="centered-last">Welcome to my digital scrapbook! Here I am sharing some of my bits of 
            my hostel life with you!
          </span>

        <h2>First Year Hostel</h2>
        <p>I got Hostel 1 in my first year. Well I knew that the rooms of the hostels were not going to be small. 
          But little did I know that these rooms were still much better than the ones I was going to get in my further
          years of study. But still it had its own perks like a very good mess, and a whole lot of good friends. 
          I will always remember my "last wing last floor" room.

        <h2>First Mood Indigo</h2>
        <p>MOOD INDIGO was the biggest thing that we were all waiting for and boy was that a crazy experience for us 
          in the first year itself. I could not attend all the 4 days but the 2 days that I enjoyed, I cannot forget. 
          Enjoying the fun games with friends, and unexpectedly getting to listen to my favourite artist in the 
          concert... just beautiful.

        <h2>Second Year Hostel</h2>
        <p>Well in the first year I got the less nicer hostel among the two options available. But in my second year 
          guess what... I got the worst one among the possible options. Welcome to Hostel 6, "Vikings". I do not know 
          Worst part of this hostel was that I did not have any of my close friends with me in the same hostel. I do 
          not know how I managed to survive 2 semesters.

        <p id="sike">Finally after a year full of living in the "worst hostel of IITB", I was finally alloted one of the 
          best hostels in IITB, that is Hostel 17. Thanks to the fast constructions of new 3 hostels, we got to 
          escape our parent hostels and move into single-occupany rooms! <BR> <span style="font-size: larger; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">BUT</span>
